## eCell NSUT

One might think that the capabilities of an entrepreneurship cell is limited to gathering accolades in competitions, but here at eCell NSUT, we take it as a challenge to propel our ideas to greater heights. We take initiatives to develop and adapt ourselves into the changing popular market culture, while having a strong hold over our core and foundational values, irrespective of our predicament.

eCell NSUT has been successful in creating a space for itself in the entrepreneurial circuit of India and cross borders as well. As one of the most active and cross-functional entrepreneurship entities of Delhi, our mission is to work on different projects and start-ups while becoming the most approachable eCell.
